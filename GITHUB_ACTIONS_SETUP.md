# 🚀 GitHub Actions Setup for GoDaddy Deployment

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you set up **automatic deployment** from GitHub to your GoDaddy hosting using GitHub Actions. Every time you push to your main branch, your website will automatically deploy!

## ✨ Benefits of GitHub Actions

- **🔄 Automatic deployment** on every push
- **📊 Build logs** and deployment history
- **🛡️ Security** - credentials stored as secrets
- **📱 Easy rollback** to previous versions
- **🔔 Notifications** on deployment status
- **💰 Free** for public repositories

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### **Step 1: Get GoDaddy FTP Credentials**

1. **Login to GoDaddy** control panel
2. **Go to Web Hosting** → **Manage**
3. **Find FTP credentials**:
   - **FTP Host**: Usually `yourdomain.com` or server IP
   - **FTP Username**: Your hosting username
   - **FTP Password**: Your hosting password
   - **Port**: Usually 21 (default)

### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. **Click "New repository secret"**
4. **Add these secrets**:

```
FTP_HOST = yourdomain.com (or server IP)
FTP_USERNAME = your_ftp_username
FTP_PASSWORD = your_ftp_password
WEBSITE_URL = https://yourdomain.com
```

### **Step 3: Push the Workflow File**

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file is already created. Just commit and push:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 4: Monitor Your First Deployment**

1. **Go to Actions tab** in your GitHub repository
2. **Watch the workflow run** automatically
3. **Check for any errors** in the logs
4. **Verify deployment** by visiting your website

## 🔍 How It Works

### **Workflow Stages:**

1. **📥 Checkout** - Downloads your code
2. **📦 Setup** - Installs Node.js and dependencies
3. **🧪 Test** - Runs tests (if available)
4. **🏗️ Build** - Creates production build
5. **📊 Upload** - Saves build files as artifacts
6. **🚀 Deploy** - Uploads to GoDaddy via FTP
7. **✅ Complete** - Confirms successful deployment

### **Automatic Triggers:**

- **Push to main/master** → Automatic deployment
- **Pull request** → Build and test only (no deploy)
- **Manual trigger** → Deploy anytime via Actions tab

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### **Environment-Specific Deployments**

You can create multiple workflows for different environments:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
name: Deploy to Staging
on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]
# ... staging deployment logic

# .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml  
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
# ... production deployment logic
```

### **Conditional Deployments**

Deploy only when specific files change:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'public/**'
      - 'package.json'
```

### **Scheduled Deployments**

Deploy automatically at specific times:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Built-in Security:**

- **Secrets encryption** - Credentials are encrypted
- **No credential exposure** - Never shown in logs
- **Branch protection** - Only deploys from main/master
- **Artifact cleanup** - Build files auto-delete after 7 days

### **Additional Security:**

- **Environment protection** - Require approval for production
- **Deployment restrictions** - Limit who can deploy
- **Audit logging** - Track all deployment activities

## 📱 Notifications & Monitoring

### **Built-in Notifications:**

- **GitHub notifications** for workflow status
- **Email alerts** for failures
- **Action logs** for debugging

### **Custom Notifications:**

Add Slack, Discord, or email notifications:

```yaml
- name: 🔔 Notify Slack
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

#### **FTP Connection Failed**
- ✅ Verify FTP credentials in secrets
- ✅ Check if GoDaddy allows FTP access
- ✅ Ensure server is not blocking connections

#### **Build Failed**
- ✅ Check Node.js version compatibility
- ✅ Verify all dependencies are installed
- ✅ Check for syntax errors in code

#### **Deployment Failed**
- ✅ Verify `public_html/` directory exists
- ✅ Check FTP permissions
- ✅ Ensure sufficient disk space

### **Debug Commands:**

Add these to your workflow for debugging:

```yaml
- name: 🔍 Debug Info
  run: |
    echo "Node version: $(node --version)"
    echo "NPM version: $(npm --version)"
    echo "Build directory contents:"
    ls -la build/
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### **Performance Tracking:**

- **Build time** - Monitor build performance
- **Deployment frequency** - Track update frequency
- **Success rate** - Monitor deployment reliability

### **Cost Optimization:**

- **Cache dependencies** - Faster builds
- **Artifact cleanup** - Reduce storage costs
- **Conditional builds** - Only build when needed

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **Development Workflow:**

1. **Create feature branch** from main
2. **Make changes** and test locally
3. **Push to feature branch** (triggers build only)
4. **Create pull request** to main
5. **Review and merge** (triggers deployment)

### **Deployment Strategy:**

- **Blue-green deployment** - Zero downtime updates
- **Rollback capability** - Quick recovery from issues
- **Health checks** - Verify deployment success

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub secrets** with your GoDaddy credentials
2. **Push the workflow file** to trigger first deployment
3. **Monitor the deployment** in GitHub Actions tab
4. **Test your live website** after deployment
5. **Set up notifications** for deployment status
6. **Configure branch protection** for main branch
